## [[LifeSmack MOC]]
- How many times have you been asked for change in your lifetime? 
- How did it make you feel? 
- Now itâ€™s time to swap roles and experience what it feels like to be the one asking
- . The purpose of this challenge is to give you a new perspective on the rich vs. poor social dynamics -> particular the feeling of being dehumanized/humbled/ignored.
