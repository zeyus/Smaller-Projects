- Communication and language can be thought to belong to a continuum from:

**Meaning -> signal -> communication -> language.
**

- [[signs]] - something that represents something else. An expression that points to a meaning
- Language is a [[symbolic sign system]] that follows a particular set of rules for combining its components
- #design features of human languages:
    - Duality of patterning: a finite set of meaningless elements can be combinted into infinitely many meaningful [[signs]].
        - **pustota:** But the further use of [[signs]] can not be used to create infinite number of meanings or descriptions because we are bound by [[syntax]] and [[signs]] by themselves. Would be we able to communicate perfectly if we would label everything with signs?
    - Productivity/flexibility: we can create meaningful sentences we have never heard before and we can communicate about everything (almost)
        - Can we?? What about psychedelic experiences?
    - Displacement: we can talk about entities that are absent(or imaginary) in the situation of communication. I guess this is fascinating in comparison to animals - who only signal about things in their environment or [[fitness points]].
- [[lexicon]] - the repertoire of words and their corresponding meanings: "dog", "mailman", "jump"
- [[syntax]] - regularities/norms for how to combine words to compose sentences: "the dog was bidden by the mailman"
- [[pragmatics]] - speakers intention: often **[[signs]] take on different meanings** in different types of [[context]]
    - Environment adjusts the meaning and then [[Bottom-up]] everything else.
    - "Can you pass me the salt?" - is more of a request rather than a question
- [[model]]s of [[communication]]

The process of transporting information(?) - or is it also a bit of [[Programming attention]]? Both?

Words/sentences are a sophisticated way of bringing the recipients [[attention]] to a particular idea or topic. But they have to be there in some way already?

Activating [[associations]] that are already accessible in the [[mind]] of our recepient.

    - [[Claude Shannon]] and his Information Theory. He was curious about how [[information]] **can travel** in physical systems.

        - We can think about how information travels(is it transported?) from one persons [[mind]] into another persons [[mind]]. Or not necessarily a person. It could be from a computer to a person.
    - [[Roman Jakobson]] model of communication

        - Includes [[context]] and code(?)
- According to [[Michael Tomasello]], language relies on general [[cognition]] - #memory, #attention and #learning
    - This makes sense with the above statements about models of communication - that it is not only transporting information but [[Activating associations]] and [[Programming attention]].

- Talking the Talk:
    - Stone tools became more complex, art flourished, and personal jewelry
appeared for the first time. Corballis (2004) argued that this cultural and technological flowering was made possible by the development of language and the changes in the ways of thinking that language allows. With proper language, humans could move beyond the here-and-now and could talk about things and ideas other than objects immediately in front of them. They could reason about possibilities. They could speculate, talk about the future, make plans, and talk hypothetically about “what if?” They could form complex conditional plans for the future (“**if you do this I’ll do that or else if . . .**”). Fossil evidence shows that the articulatory apparatus – the tongue, teeth, larynx, and muscles that control them – hasn’t changed significantly in the past 50,000 years – since about the same time as this cultural flowering. Here then is a more conservative estimate of the origin of true language: something happened about 50,000 years ago. Whatever it was fixed our vocal apparatus in its modern form, enabled modern language to develop, which in turn freed our hands for other uses, and these changes, in turn, led to the development of culture. What might have happened about then? The likely answer
is a mutation in what is known as the FOXP2 gene within the past 100,000 years that led to its current form. In other primates, this gene is responsible for controlling complex movements and coordinating sensory input and output
