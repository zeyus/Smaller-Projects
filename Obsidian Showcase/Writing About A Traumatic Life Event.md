### Idea
-  Psychologist [[Richard Wiseman]] have proposed [[Journalling]] on our most difficult experiences as one of the  best ways to get a grip on our emotional immune system
-  The reason? 
	-  Journalling allows us to turn Caos and muddled incoherent lines of thoughts into a coherent narrative
	-  Journaling allows us as writers to gain greater perspective over the events unfolding in our lives. 

### How-to:
- So, try and think back over your life. Do we have any situations that has caused you a lot of pain and suffering? Are there any situation that still makes you uncomfortable when you think back on it? 
- Try and write about this event for at least fifteen minutes and be sure to include as much detail as you can about how your felt and what you sensed. 
- Think of it as fiction and write yourself some take away notes
