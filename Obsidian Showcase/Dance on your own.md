- We’ve all heard of post-traumatic stress disorder, but what about the opposite — peak experiences? 
- According to the OG of the positive psychology Abraham [[Maslow]] peak experiences are rare, but exciting, exhilarating, elevating experiences that can generate mystic and magical perceptions of reality in the experimenter.

	- WE MUST DANCE
		1. Create a dance playlist on YouTube or Spotify (It should last at least 1 hour) 
		2. Find an empty room
		3. Turn the music wayup
		4. Dance and let your body decide how it wants to move from moment to moment
