# Cognition & Communication
- Okay, it starts with [[associations]] and [[attention]]. Particularly with the ability of our [[cognition]] to generate and/or [[Activating associations]] and directing and/or [[Programming attention]] to achieve our goals. That's what the [[mind]] is for, after all.
- Now this process of generation of associations and direction of attention can and was originally happening automatically, from the [[Environment (underrated)]]. We are, after all, an [[Extended Mind]].
- We already had an ability to "communicate" (encode and transmit [[information]]) - this is a fundamental process of all living beings. Mukhomors are red - poisonous, etc etc.
- **But, this is something that was happening without intentionality.**
- Language, which is a [[symbolic sign system]] is a technology([[Tools for Thought]]) that lets us create [[symbol]]s intentionally. Create something that represents something. And it also **stores** information. 
- The cool thing is - is when it is applied accross a population - we have a first instance of #CI or collective intelligence.
- This also creates a positive feedback loop - new symbols allow for new thoughts to be thought, which allows for new symbols to be created, which allows for more #abstraction and complexity to emerge. Your fav [[Bottom-up]] in practice.
- Then, this technology, is made more complicated with the use of [[syntax]], [[pragmatics]], and [[lexicon]] - which allows for exponential growth of complexity and abstraction.
    - And then there has been systems on top of it! [[SRS]] and practically everything else? But how do we further make use of that initial thing that makes it happen - attentions and associations?

## Notes
- It builds on top of our existing mental processes. What else of the same kind can we do? [[Tools for Thought]]
- I guess linguistics is the study of language - the technology, rather than the cognitive functions that facilitate it.
- Of course [[Michael Tomasello]] is right.
- {{[[TODO]]}} Add thoughts from https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html#part2 here
- [[exam]]
- Seems like it's just emergence of abstractions built on top of information processing - similar to how nervous system operates with the help of [[neurons]] and [[neural networks]]
