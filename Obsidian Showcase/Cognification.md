# Cognification
The idea to leverage IQ in any medium

### notes from books
#### [[What Technology Wants]]
- Find something that becomes better with a raise in IQ -> "Add AI" -> it’s the new “add electricity" #Idea 
- We want artificial smartness (not Consciousness) we want a car that is a narrowly focused on the road, but doesn’t stay emotional after a fight with the garage #A-Fine-Argument 	
- Don’t wish for planes that fly like birds, admit that robots like [[Baxter]] can work side by side with humans (Baxter is revolutionary in the robot assembly business as it is a [[Robot]] that is aware of humans around it so it doesn’t hurt it)
- We’ll need robotnanies that maintain robots - and need people to expand the platforms that new techfirms invent
- We are not in race against machines, but with them -> the better you can work together with machines, the better you will do #SoundAdvice
