[[What Technology Wants]]
	- believeable [[Virtual Worlds]] is almost here
	- [[Project Sensa]] is the second edition of [[Second Life]]
	- [[Minecraft]] is a new version of [[Second Life ]]
	- Eyecontact, with [[Eyetracking]], gives much deeper social interactions online
	- Voice and fingerinteraction with phone will be the future - not big gestures that mimic exercise (think [[VoiceMessages]] and [[SignLanguage]]) #Idea #StartStraks
	- If it doesn’t have [[Sensor]]s and can’t be interacted with it’s broken -> it should sound and feel beautiful (we stroke, touch, feel quality and responsiveness) #A-Fine-Argument 
	- [[Wearables]] is closer than outside screens -> [[BrainTrackers]] are next
	- Drones can now be done in VR -> you are actually flying -> beaming yourself up into the sky #Idea 
	- [[Virtual Worlds]] is fully tracked - but with [[Sensor]]s eveywhere, [[AI]] is making the real world trackable and nudgeable and gameable as well
	- [[AR]] makes cashed messages and geocache treasures more real #Idea 
	- We can be anything (a lobster or switch legs for arms) -> our [[Umwelt]] is highly adaptable
