# Ideas
- [[Vertebrates]] vs [[Invertebrates]]
- The Nervous System is only an efficient computation machine 
	- not necessary for life
- Octopuses are funny creatures
- Embodied Cognition (constraining and giving opportunity) -> [[Embodiment]]
- [[Consciousness]] was also formed gradually through evolution: so how does it feel to be an octopus? 
	- Not all animals integrate their senses like we do into a coherent all
	- Often animals have a [[Split Brain]] type of life - better at detecting danger to their left and better at finding food to their right
	- Having a [[Ventral]] and a [[Dorsal]] stream also means we can see without perceiving 
- Dehan: "we can only learn from feedback close in time if no awareness is involved"
- Late-comer view vs. Transformation view 
- Animals prob. Feel pain
	- E.g.
		- Fish want pain killers
			- to go for [[Veganism]]
- Efference copies - talking to one self 
- Different [[Global Workspace]]
- Why do species have the lifespan they have? The evolution of an animal will make it more able to survive at certain points in its lifespan (maybe it is dangerous to be an adult because prey can see you easier)
