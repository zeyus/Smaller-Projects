[[What Technology Wants]]
- every year I own less than I did a year ago
- The Mary Poppins bag full of wonders #WonderWords
- [[Software]] eats everything (cars becomes small digital entertainment centers)
- [[Subscriptions]] compared to one-time buy forces an ongoing relationship between user and service
- Ask for add-ons and point out errors
	- A crowd of amateurs can be as good as one pro -> Just like [[Peter Diamandis]]'s [[FutureLoop]]
- Most goods and tools are short term use and we like immediate access
- [[Dematerialization]] and [[Decentralization]] is the next
- The bigger the cloud - the smaller our laptop/phone needs to be
