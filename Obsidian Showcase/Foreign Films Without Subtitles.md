How well do you understand emotions?
- Well, you’re about to find out a way to practise:
	- Having research participants watch soundless videos of people interacting is a classic paradigm (Fölster, Hess, Hühnel, and Werheid (2015)) used to measure empathy. 
	- Whilst I personally don’t recommend watching a film with no sound, as it will likely be very boring, I do recommend watching an entire foreign film without subtitles
	- This will enable you to practice picking up on culturally specific and subtle emotional cues ooooonly from context and sub-communications. 
	- You’ll can also try to consciously perceive and appreciate the camera work to help you make sense of the overall tone.
